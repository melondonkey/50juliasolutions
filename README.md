50 Challenging Problems--Solved with Julia!

To teach myself Julia, I've decided to work through Frederick Mosteller's Book, Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability With Solutions, solving the problems using simulations in Julia.  This is the code for the solutions.  Out of respect for copyright, I have not included the problem text, but the book can be cheaply obtained on Amazon (and many problems can be seen in the preview).  

My background is with SAS and R, so my code isn't always the most elegant, but I am judging it on whether it correctly answers the questions.  


Constructive feedback is welcome.  Most of the people in the Julia community are a lot smarter than I am.
